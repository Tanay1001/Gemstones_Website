<!--****WHAT ARE GEMSTONES****-->
<h2><font color="#e3c676"><center>What are gemstones?</center></font></h2>

<h4>
A gemstone (also called a gem, fine gem, jewel, precious stone, or semi-precious stone) is 
a piece of mineral crystal, which, in cut and polished form, is used to make jewellery or other 
adornments. However, certain rocks (such as lapis lazuli and opal) and occasionally organic 
materials that are not minerals (such as amber, jet, and pearl) are also used for jewellery 
and are therefore often considered gemstones as well. Most gemstones are hard, but some soft 
minerals are used in jewellery because of their lustre or other physical properties that have 
aesthetic value. Rarity is another characteristic that lends value to a gemstone.

<!--****HOW ARE THEY FORMED****-->
<br><br>
<h2><font color="#e3c676"><center>How are they formed?</center></font></h2>
<h4>
There are five requirements for crystals to form: ingredients and temperature, pressure, time, and space. 
To better explain the basics of mineral crystallisation lets talk about rock candy for a second. Rock candy is simply crystallised sugar.
If you stir as much sugar as possible into a bottom of water you will see it begin to settle at the bottom of the pot. 
When no more sugar can dissolve, you have reached saturation point. The water can't absorb any more sugar, this is known as super-saturated
This is a great way to understand just how gemstones form.
Now bring the pot to a boil- the saturation level changes at boiling point. You can add more sugar, you should do so until you reach super-saturation.
 At this stage, you should remove the pot from heat. As the water returns to room temperature the sugar it can hold returns to its previous level. 
The excess sugar comes out of its solution and crystallises as it does so.
Now, hang a string in the solution so the crystals have something to grow on. Ideally, weight the string to keep it straight. Once the water has 
totally cooled the string will be covered in crystals.
Gemstone Formation Process
Generally speaking there are 4 ways gemstones can form. They are<br>
Igneous- These minerals are created deep within the earth (Diamonds, Ruby, Sapphire, Peridot)<br>
Hydrothermal- Similar to the rock candy example, gemstones are formed when bodies of mineral rich water cool<br>
Metamorphic- As the name suggests, these are gems that are 'morphed' due to intense heat and pressure. (Sapphire, Ruby, Spinel, Garnet)<br>
Sedimentary- Gems that form due to water depositing sediments (Malachite, Azurite, Opal)<br>

<h4>
Gemstones are beautiful pieces of nature that come from the earth that can be made into different types of jewelry. Gemstones are valuable: A lot of 
time, effort, and information go into mining gemstones. As time goes on, more and more natural gemstones are becoming rarer. As the cost of mining rises
, these natural gemstones are harder to come by. Their value is constantly rising due to their scarcity, so one can make a profit from selling them as well.
A number of gemstones have gained fame, either because of their size and beauty or because of the people who owned or wore them.

<h2><font color="#e3c676"><center>Types of gemstones</center></font></h2>
<h4>
<br><br>
Of the more than 2,000 identified natural minerals, fewer than 100 are used as gemstones and only 16 have achieved importance. These are beryl, chrysoberyl, 
corundum, diamond, feldspar, garnet, jade, lazurite, olivine, opal, quartz, spinel, topaz, tourmaline, turquoise, and zircon. Some of these minerals provide 
more than one type of gem; beryl, for example, provides emeralds and aquamarines, while corundum provides rubies and sapphires. In virtually all cases, the 
minerals have to be cut and polished for use in jewelry.
Except for diamond, which presents special problems because of its very great hardness (see diamond cutting), gemstones are cut and polished in any of three ways. 
Agate, opal, jasper, onyx, chalcedony (all with a Mohs hardness of 7 or less) may be tumbled; that is, they may be placed in a cylinder with abrasive grit and water 
and the cylinder rotated about its long axis. The stones become polished but are irregular in shape. Second, the same kinds of gemstones may instead be cut en cabochon 
(i.e., with a rounded upper surface and a flat underside) and polished on water- or motor-driven sandstone wheels. Third, gemstones with Mohs hardness of more than 7 
may be cut with a carborundum saw and then mounted in a holder (dop) and pressed against a lathe that can be made to revolve with extreme rapidity. The lathe carries a 
point or small disk of soft iron, which can vary in diameter from that of a pinhead to a quarter of an inch. The face of the disk is charged with carborundum grit, 
diamond dust, or other abrasives, along with oil.<br>
