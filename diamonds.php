<!--****WHAT ARE DIAMONDS****-->
<h2><font color="#e3c676"><center>What are diamonds?</center></font></h2>


<h4>
Diamond is a rare, naturally occurring mineral composed of carbon. 
Each carbon atom in a diamond is surrounded by four other carbon atoms 
and connected to them by strong covalent bonds - the strongest type of 
chemical bond. This simple, uniform, tightly-bonded arrangement yields one 
of the most durable and versatile substances known.Diamond also has special 
optical properties such as a high index of refraction, high dispersion, and 
high luster. These properties help make diamond the world's most popular gemstone 
and enable it to be used in specialty lenses where durability and performance 
are required.

<!--****HOW ARE THEY FORMED****-->
<br><br>
<h2><font color="#e3c676"><center>How are they formed?</center></font></h2>

<h4>
Geologists believe that the diamonds in all of Earth's commercial diamond deposits 
were formed in the mantle and delivered to the surface by deep-source volcanic eruptions. 
These eruptions produce the kimberlite and lamproite pipes that are sought after by 
diamond prospectors.
<br><br>
Tiny diamonds have been found in rocks that are thought to have been subducted deep into 
the mantle by plate tectonic processes - then returned to the surface Diamond formation in 
a subducting plate might occur as little as 50 miles (80 kilometers) below the surface and 
at temperatures as low as 390 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Centigrade) 
<center><img src="gif1.gif"></center>
Throughout its history, Earth has been repeatedly hit by large asteroids. When these asteroids 
strike the earth, extreme temperatures and pressures are produced. For example: when a six mile
(10 kilometer) wide asteroid strikes the earth, it can be traveling at up to 9 to 12 miles per 
second (15 to 20 kilometers per second). Upon impact this hypervelocity object would produce an 
energy burst equivalent to many nuclear weapons and temperatures hotter than the sun's surface.
The high temperature and pressure conditions of such an impact are more than adequate to form diamonds.

<h4>
Nothing fascinates more than a diamond. From their shape and size, to their remarkable ability to capture the 
light, a diamond is so much more than a precious stone, it is a piece of an exquisite history. As such, we look 
back at the world's most famous diamonds ever discovered by humankind.

<!--****WHERE ARE THEY FOUND****-->
<br><br>
<h2><font color="#e3c676"><center>Where are they found?</center></font></h2>
<h4>
Most of the world's natural gem-quality diamonds are mined in countries where citizens do not purchase a lot of diamond 
jewelry. The leading consumers of diamond jewelry include the United States, India, China, the European Union, Japan, Hong 
Kong, and the Middle East. The United States consumes over 40% of the world's diamond jewelry, and the other areas listed 
together consume at least another 40% of the world's diamond jewelry.

<div id="div1" align="center">
<h1>Carat<h1>
<img src="carat.jpg" width=100%>
<h4>
To put it simply, diamond carat weight measures how much a diamond weighs. 
A metric "carat" is defined as 200 milligrams. Each carat is subdivided into 100 'points.' This allows 
very precise measurements to the hundredth decimal place. A jeweler may describe the weight of a diamond 
below one carat by its 'points' alone. For instance, the jeweler may refer to a diamond that weighs 0.25 
carats as a 'twenty-five pointer.' Diamond weights greater than one carat are expressed in carats and decimals. 
A 1.08 carat stone would be described as 'one point oh eight carats.'
All else being equal, diamond price increases with diamond carat weight because larger diamonds are rarer and more 
desirable. However, two diamonds of equal carat weight can have very different values (and prices) depending on three 
other factors of the diamond 4Cs: Color, Clarity, and Cut.
While now you know what carat means, it's also important to remember that a diamond's value is determined using all of 
the 4Cs, and not just carat weight.

<h4><font color="#e3c676">
Understanding what diamond color means helps in choosing the right diamond. Interestingly, the diamond color evaluation of 
most gem-quality diamonds is based on the absence of color. A chemically pure and structurally perfect diamond has no hue, 
like a drop of pure water, and consequently, a higher value. GIA's D-to-Z diamond color-grading system measures the degree 
of colorlessness by comparing a stone under controlled lighting and precise viewing conditions to masterstones of established color value.
Many of these diamond color distinctions are so subtle that they are invisible to the untrained eye; however, these distinctions make 
a very big difference in diamond quality and price. Hence, it is important to get a GIA expert's opinion in evaluating the best color for your diamond.

<h1>Clarity<h1>
<img src="clarity.jpg" width=100%>
<h4>
To understand diamond clarity, we must first understand how diamonds are created. Natural diamonds are the result of carbon exposed to tremendous heat and 
pressure deep in the earth. This process can result in a variety of internal characteristics called 'inclusions' and external characteristics called 'blemishes.'
Evaluating diamond clarity involves determining the number, size, relief, nature, and position of these characteristics, as well as how these affect the overall 
appearance of the stone. If you are trying to determine what is the best clarity for a diamond, remember that no diamond is perfectly pure. But the closer it comes 
to purity, the better its clarity.To the naked eye, diamond's may look exactly the same, 
but these diamonds are quite different in terms of overall quality. This is why expert and accurate assessment of diamond clarity is extremely important. Knowing what diamond 
clarity truly means helps you understand the factors that contribute to diamond quality and price.

<h4><font color="#e3c676">
Diamonds are renowned for their ability to transmit light and sparkle so intensely. We often think of a diamond's cut as shape but what 
diamond cut actually does mean how well a diamond's facets interact with light.
Achieving the best cut for a diamond reflects in the stone's final beauty and value. And of all the diamond 4Cs, it is the most complex and technically difficult to analyze. 
To determine the cut grade of the standard round brilliant diamond - the shape that dominates the majority of diamond jewelry. These proportions allow to evaluate what the best cut 
for a diamond is, by studying how successfully a diamond interacts 
with light to create desirable visual effects, such as:
Brightness: Internal and external white light reflected from a diamond
Fire: The scattering of white light into all the colors of the rainbow
Scintillation: The amount of sparkle a diamond produces, and the pattern of light and dark areas caused by reflections within the diamond
